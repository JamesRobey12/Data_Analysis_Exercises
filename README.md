# Data_Analysis_Exercises

Hi, I'm sharing these blank exercises as a tool for anyone learning Pandas in python to use as they wish. 

When trying to remember some of these functions, I have found that doing something, much like this exercise, makes you remember the functions and their key parameters far more than trying to learn them via flashcards. It can be completely quickly and repeated in spaced intervals to make reset_index() and its application stick in your memory, which is handy whenever working on a data problem where it's required. 

I'm sharing the file to save you the time of making your own, and I hope it is helpful for you!
